# Angular Reference App

This is a AngularJS reference app. It demonstrates various aspects of
Angular, but not even close to all of them.

## Usage

Simply serve the directory over HTTP and access it in your browser.

Example:

1. Serve the static files (e.g. using the Node
[http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server)
package):

        http-server -p 4321

2. Point your browser to it:

        http://localhost:4321
